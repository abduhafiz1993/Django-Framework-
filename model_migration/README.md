# SQL

## Databases
Before we get into how to use the SQL language, we should discuss how our data is stored. When using SQL, we’ll work with a relational database where we can find all of our data stored in a number of tables. Each of these tables is made up of a set number of columns and a flexible number of rows.

There are several different relational database management systems that are commonly used to store information, and that can easily interact with SQL commands:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
…
The first two, MySQL and PostgreSQL, are heavier-duty database management systems that are typically run on servers separate from those running a website. SQLite, on the other hand, is a lighter-weight system that can store all of its data in a single file. We’ll be using SQLite throughout this course, as it is the default system used by Django
